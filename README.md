## My first RayCaster With miniLibX
Well, before diving deep, there are checklists we need to make sure we do have at out disposal and as usal, we use C.<br>
### ðŸ“ŽLet's make sure the miniLibx is installed and working properly.
As stated in th pdf guide, we can either use minilibx version avialable on the operating system (imac) or from it sources: I will not try to explain anythind here, there are docs for both choices <br>
- ðŸ¥‡ If you decide to use the version from the source, then follow instructions from this github  https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.
- ðŸ¥ˆ And you may need to follow this docs for getting started. https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html#compilation-on-macos .
